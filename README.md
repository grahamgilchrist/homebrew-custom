homebrew-custom
=================
Homebrew tap repository with custom formulae.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap grahamgilchrist/custom` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install grahamgilchrist/custom/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grahamgilchrist/homebrew-custom/master/<formula>.rb
```
